# Shitty Steambot

Just a "for fun" project done in 2-3 hours. Don't expect anything from it.

## Use
Create a Discord bot with a config.json in root folder like this one : 
```json
{
    "Token": "TheTokenYouWouldFindInYourApps",
    "BotPrefix": "AnyPrefixYouWant" // I personally choose "!"
}
```
And you're good to go if I didn't do a bad job

## Docker
lmao do it yourself, it's a very small project
